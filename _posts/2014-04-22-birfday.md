YARR, this is a test. I'm mostly posting this because I want to find out how long the automatically-generated excerpts are. A sentence? The entire first paragraph? Bueller? YO, I THINK I'M LOSING MY MIND THIS TIME THIS TIME I'M LOSING MY MIND THAT'S RIGHT SED--

OK, I think that's good. How does that look? What if I do a blockquote thing?

This is an H1
=============

This is an H2
-------------

### H3 4 Lyfe

#### h4, j'adore ####

I like the second style better, from a writing point of view.


    Code block via four spaces.
