We do virtual standups for $WORK, mostly so we know what everyone else
is working on, we can let the people back in Vancouver know what's going
on, communication is good, &c. Each person gives their answers to three
questions:

1. What did I do yesterday?
2. What do I plan to do today?
3. What are my blocks?

Because #3 is almost always "no blocks", I started adding my own touch
to the standups. And thus I present to you the "Block of the Day"
archive.

### **SNOW!**

* It's snow.
* Crafted using four snowballs.

* They're automatically generated in abandoned mines and villages.

### **FENCE!**

April 7th, 2015

* Fences are actually 1.5 blocks tall, meaning most mobs cannot jump over them.
* Umm. The recipe changed in version 1.8. It was really confusing.
* Also in 1.8, they started keeping the colour of the used wood. This is an oak fence.

### **DIRT!**

April 3rd, 2015

* Dirt is a block found abundantly in the overworld.
* Using a hoe on dirt will turn it into farmland.
* When a dirt block is adjacent to a grass block and is exposed to a light level of at least four, it will eventually be converted into a grass block at random intervals.

### **LAVA!**

April 2nd, 2015

August 11th, 2014

(From the Tekkit modpack, specifically the Thermal Expansion mod.)

* It's from the Thermal Expansion mod.
* Grinds ores down to powder with can be smelted (or used for other stuff). Somehow this results in twice as many ingots as smelting the ore directly. This doesn't make any sense.
* I tried making one of these last night but I can't find any gold ore.
* Plus there's a lot of crazy shit in the Tekkit modpack.

### **MONSTER SPAWNER!**

July 23rd, 2014

* Found in dungeons, abandoned mineshafts, strongholds, and nether fortresses.

### **STONE BRICK!**

July 18th, 2014

* To get: Use your pickaxe to mine stone, which drops as cobblestone.  Smelt the cobblestone back into smooth stone. Then craft the smooth stone into stone brick.
* As Stone Bricks offer no real advantage over Cobblestone, their main use is decoration, and are commonly used as a building material for castles by many players, due to the medieval look not found in Stone and Cobblestone.

### **BOOKSHELF!**

July 17th, 2014

* Adjacent bookshelves increase the maximum power of an enchanting table.
* Minecraft libraries are gorgeous:

### **ICE!**

July 16th, 2014

* Water can only freeze if there is at least one horizontally adjacent non-water block. This makes ponds, rivers, etc. freeze from the edges in to the middle.
* If an ocean biome is beside a snow biome, "ice shelves" may be formed.

### **CRAFTING TABLE!**

July 15th, 2014

* This is one of the most essential blocks in Minecraft.
* Without the crafting table, you're restricted to crafting items with 2x2 recipes. The crafting table allows you to make items with 3x3 recipes.

* Wooden planks can be crafted into 23 items, second to iron ingots.
* The value of building with wood planks is disputed. Structures built of planks can be burned down easily, either by accident or by griefers. It is often used, regardless of the dangers, due to its abundance in trees and its aesthetically pleasing appearance.

### **MELON!**

July 8th, 2014

* The block form is square, yet the slices are round.
* Melon slices suck as a food source.

### **COBBLESTONE!**

July 7th, 2014

### **Leaves!**

July 3rd, 2014

### **Coal ore**

July 2nd, 2014

Fun facts:

* Coal Ore is a mineral block that drops coal lumps when mined.
* Smelting the ore instead of mining it is highly inefficient, as it would require fuel to acquire the coal, which is the exact purpose of obtaining this ore in the first place.
* One can also acquire large amounts of experience by mining coal.

### **Obsidian!**

July 1st, 2014

Fun facts:

* Obsidian is one of the hardest blocks to destroy in Minecraft. In reality, obsidian is glass-like in texture and quite fragile.
