Dag, I should find a better syntax highlighter for MarkDown docs in vim.  It's borking at the apostrophe from "I'm-a cut you". :(

Also, the MarkDown syntax to get that work easily was a little awkward.
Ah well, it makes sense, anyway.

**UPDATE**: Yay, [Markdown : Syntax highlight for Markdown text
files](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2882)!
